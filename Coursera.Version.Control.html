    This is my sample file i am adding to repositroy to have my first GitHub push experience.
    Add: Stage the file and make it trackable.
       -> add file name after add for whatever you want to add to the repo,
       if current directory is the one to be added go for git add ., for albiet more of a general stage.
    Commit: Save your changes to stage.
    Push: Save it to remote repo.
    Test Line Addition
    Ways to add branch:
    1. git branch branch_name
    // just adds the branch nothing else
    2. git checkout -B branch_name
    // not only creates a branch, but also enters it.
    to push the branch contents to the main:
    git push -u origin branch_name.
